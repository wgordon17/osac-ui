# OSAC UI

OSAC UI is the web console for the [Open Sovereign AI Cloud (OSAC)](https://github.com/osac-project/) project — a self-service platform for deploying OpenShift clusters, virtual machines, and bare metal hosts. It is a pnpm monorepo consisting of a React 19 + PatternFly 6 single-page application and a Go chi reverse proxy that handles OIDC authentication and forwards requests to the upstream [fulfillment-service](https://github.com/osac-project/fulfillment-service).

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `apps/app-frontend/` | React SPA (Vite, React 19, TanStack Query, react-router-dom 7) |
| `libs/api-contracts/` | Shared TypeScript types and wire normalizers |
| `libs/types/` | Generated protobuf types (do not edit) |
| `libs/ui-components/` | Shared PatternFly 6 component library |
| `proxy/` | Go chi reverse proxy — OIDC auth + API forwarding |
| `deploy/chart/` | Helm chart for Kubernetes/OpenShift deployment |
| `docs/` | Architecture and deployment documentation |

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, pnpm 9+, Go 1.23+

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the Go proxy (requires a running fulfillment API) and Vite dev server:

```bash
FULFILLMENT_API_URL=https://fulfillment.your-env.example.com pnpm dev
```
